# Black Wings Hackathon AI_Assistant

# Description:
Our chatbot is made to help users find food banks and volunteer opportunities in their geographic location.

# Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python

# Lessons Learned
1. This was our first time using the OpenAI API. Given the recent updates earlier this month, we needed to learn quickly
2. Our first time prompt engineering! We learned basic techniques for prompting because it's more complex than it may first appear to be!

# Next Steps
If we had more time, these are the features we would implement:

1. A toggle button to keep the focus on one topic at a time
2. Have chatbot integrate the Kintone database we created
